  abstract  = {There has been recent interest by payers, health care systems, and researchers in
               the development of machine learning and artificial intelligence models that predict
               an individual's probability of developing opioid use disorder. The scores generated
               by these algorithms can be used by physicians to tailor the prescribing of opioids
               for the treatment of pain, reducing or foregoing prescribing to individuals deemed
               to be at high risk, or increasing prescribing for patients deemed to be at low risk.
               This paper constructs a machine learning algorithm to predict opioid use disorder
               risk using commercially available claims data similar to those utilized in the development
               of proprietary opioid use disorder prediction algorithms. We study risk scores generated
               by the machine learning model in a setting with quasi-experimental variation in the
               likelihood that doctors prescribe opioids, generated by changes in the legal structure
               for monitoring physician prescribing. We find that machine-predicted risk scores do
               not appear to correlate at all with the individual-specific heterogeneous treatment
               effect of receiving opioids. The paper identifies a new source of algorithmic unfairness
               in machine learning applications for health care and precision medicine, arising from
               the researcher's choice of objective function. While precision medicine should guide
               physician treatment decisions based on the heterogeneous causal impact of a course
               of treatment for an individual, allocating treatments to individuals receiving the
               most benefit and recommending caution for those most likely to experience harmful
               side effects, ML models in health care are often trained on proxies like individual
               baseline risk, and are not necessarily informative in deciding who would most benefit,
               or be harmed, by a course of treatment.},

  abstract = {{Current approaches to identifying individuals at high risk for opioid overdose target many patients who are not truly at high risk.To develop and validate a machine-learning algorithm to predict opioid overdose risk among Medicare beneficiaries with at least 1 opioid prescription.A prognostic study was conducted between September 1, 2017, and December 31, 2018. Participants (n = 560 057) included fee-for-service Medicare beneficiaries without cancer who filled 1 or more opioid prescriptions from January 1, 2011, to December 31, 2015. Beneficiaries were randomly and equally divided into training, testing, and validation samples.Potential predictors (n = 268), including sociodemographics, health status, patterns of opioid use, and practitioner-level and regional-level factors, were measured in 3-month windows, starting 3 months before initiating opioids until loss of follow-up or the end of observation.Opioid overdose episodes from inpatient and emergency department claims were identified. Multivariate logistic regression (MLR), least absolute shrinkage and selection operator–type regression (LASSO), random forest (RF), gradient boosting machine (GBM), and deep neural network (DNN) were applied to predict overdose risk in the subsequent 3 months after initiation of treatment with prescription opioids. Prediction performance was assessed using the C statistic and other metrics (eg, sensitivity, specificity, and number needed to evaluate [NNE] to identify one overdose). The Youden index was used to identify the optimized threshold of predicted score that balanced sensitivity and specificity.Beneficiaries in the training (n = 186 686), testing (n = 186 685), and validation (n = 186 686) samples had similar characteristics (mean [SD] age of 68.0 [14.5] years, and approximately 63\\% were female, 82\\% were white, 35\\% had disabilities, 41\\% were dual eligible, and 0.60\\% had at least 1 overdose episode). In the validation sample, the DNN (C statistic = 0.91; 95\\% CI, 0.88-0.93) and GBM (C statistic = 0.90; 95\\% CI, 0.87-0.94) algorithms outperformed the LASSO (C statistic = 0.84; 95\\% CI, 0.80-0.89), RF (C statistic = 0.80; 95\\% CI, 0.75-0.84), and MLR (C statistic = 0.75; 95\\% CI, 0.69-0.80) methods for predicting opioid overdose. At the optimized sensitivity and specificity, DNN had a sensitivity of 92.3\\%, specificity of 75.7\\%, NNE of 542, positive predictive value of 0.18\\%, and negative predictive value of 99.9\\%. The DNN classified patients into low-risk (76.2\\% [142 180] of the cohort), medium-risk (18.6\\% [34 579] of the cohort), and high-risk (5.2\\% [9747] of the cohort) subgroups, with only 1 in 10 000 in the low-risk subgroup having an overdose episode. More than 90\\% of overdose episodes occurred in the high-risk and medium-risk subgroups, although positive predictive values were low, given the rare overdose outcome.Machine-learning algorithms appear to perform well for risk prediction and stratification of opioid overdose, especially in identifying low-risk subgroups that have minimal risk of overdose.}},

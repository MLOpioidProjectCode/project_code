  abstract  = {There has been recent interest by payers, health care systems, and researchers in
               the development of machine learning and artificial intelligence models that predict
               an individual's probability of developing opioid use disorder. The scores generated
               by these algorithms can be used by physicians to tailor the prescribing of opioids
               for the treatment of pain, reducing or foregoing prescribing to individuals deemed
               to be at high risk, or increasing prescribing for patients deemed to be at low risk.
               This paper constructs a machine learning algorithm to predict opioid use disorder
               risk using commercially available claims data similar to those utilized in the development
               of proprietary opioid use disorder prediction algorithms. We study risk scores generated
               by the machine learning model in a setting with quasi-experimental variation in the
               likelihood that doctors prescribe opioids, generated by changes in the legal structure
               for monitoring physician prescribing. We find that machine-predicted risk scores do
               not appear to correlate at all with the individual-specific heterogeneous treatment
               effect of receiving opioids. The paper identifies a new source of algorithmic unfairness
               in machine learning applications for health care and precision medicine, arising from
               the researcher's choice of objective function. While precision medicine should guide
               physician treatment decisions based on the heterogeneous causal impact of a course
               of treatment for an individual, allocating treatments to individuals receiving the
               most benefit and recommending caution for those most likely to experience harmful
               side effects, ML models in health care are often trained on proxies like individual
               baseline risk, and are not necessarily informative in deciding who would most benefit,
               or be harmed, by a course of treatment.},

# Using Machine Learning to Address the Opioid Crisis


### Abstract
##### Required length: 250 words

According to the United States Center for Disease Control, in 2019 more than 50,000 people in the United States died from opioid-related overdoses. Additionally, studies estimate that the total "economic burden" of prescription opioid misuse in the United States is $78.5 billion a year, including the costs of healthcare, lost productivity, addiction treatment, and criminal justice involvement \cite{dataabuse.gov}. While the United States is certainly not the only country suffering from this epidemic, statistics like these make it clear that COVID-19 is not the only major medical crisis nations are struggling to contain at the moment.

### Related Work
##### Required length: 1/2 to 1 page


There have been multiple studies and significant research centered around this topic, particularly in the fields of machine learning and data science. Individuals like Tara Boyle \cite{boyle2019:online} and Kiros Gebremariam \cite{KirosGPr71:online} have written capstone projects and articles attempting to make sense of publicly-available government datasets around the issue. However, the majority of scholarly research is focused around predicting one’s chances of opioid abuse based on personal characteristics. Several studies, such as Huinker’s analysis of machine learning models to predict opioid misuse \cite{huinkerpaper} go into more detail about possible machine learning algorithms which can be applied to predict possible opioid abuse, while others such as Kilby \cite{10.1145/3442188.3445891} and Lo-Ciganic W et al \cite{10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2019.0968} investigate issues with algorithmic methods currently being used in locales such as medical offices and police departments. Indeed, critique of machine learning algorithms predicting one’s chances of opioid abuse is so prevalent that even mainstream journalistic sources cover the topic, as in Szalavitz’s expose in Wired \cite{wiredarticle:online} published only two months ago. 

TODO: Expand on these summaries/works, add more.
